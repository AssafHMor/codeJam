5.a - i did not succeed in the test data with the classifier i got from the
train data i found a few errors. i guess its because i got just one
classifier from the train data and there are
multiple possible classifiers for one case and if the test data was more
similar the the train data i might have succeeded with it, the fact is that
if we get multiple classifiers on the train data, lets say the two 'end'
classifiers and get one in the "middle" of those two we might just find a
good classifier for the test data as well as the train data.

c part(bonus) - we cannot separate this data because we get a linear
classifier and the data is separated by a non-linear classifier. if we want to
change the code so it will find several linear separators. in this case lets
say it will find a classifier where all the -1
are above him one the all the -1 are blow him another one where they are all
to the left and one to the right, this way we can restrict the -1 labels only
inside the borders we created. this way we can say we found a non-linear
classifier which is made out of several linear classifiers
