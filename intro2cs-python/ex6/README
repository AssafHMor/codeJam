==================

palindrome:
this file contains 2 methods:
1. is_palindrome_1 - check if a given sting is a palindrome recursively
2. is_palindrome_2 - checks if between two given indexes a given string is a
palindrome

balanced_brackets:
this file contains 3 main methods:
1: is_balanced - returns true if the parentheses are balanced in a given
string, otherwise returns false
2: violated_balanced - if the parentheses are un-balanced: it returns the
length of the string if its possible to add parentheses so it may become a
balanced string, or the index of the unbalancing if there cannot be an adding
such that the string will be balanced.
if the string is balanced it returns -1
3. match brackets - if the string is balanced parentheses-wise, it
calculates the distance between two matching parentheses and returns a list,
where the distance is displayed at the index of each matching parentheses
if the string is unbalanced it returns an empty list.

y_tree:
this file contains a recursive method to draw a "Y" tree using the turtle library
its initial starting length is 200 but the user may change it it at each junction
it turns 30 degrees to each side relative to its previous step
